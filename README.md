# ðŸŒž Solaris â€“ Rooftop Solar Power Estimation Using Deep Learning

**Solaris** is a deep learning-based solution that estimates the solar power potential of rooftops using high-resolution aerial imagery. By leveraging a U-Net image segmentation model, it identifies suitable rooftop areas for photovoltaic (PV) panel installation and calculates the expected energy yield based on global solar irradiance data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Automate the identification of usable rooftop areas for solar panels and estimate their solar power yield.
- **Approach**: 
  - Segment rooftops using a U-Net convolutional neural network.
  - Calculate area based on image resolution.
  - Estimate solar yield using GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) and panel efficiency.
- **Dataset**: 519 high-resolution images (512Ã—512) of flat rooftops sourced from Sofia Municipality, manually labeled with binary masks.
